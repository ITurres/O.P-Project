PROJECT: LANDING PAGE

I will start with adding the boilerplate to the html file, and so i can begin.
next link the css file to the html
 once that is ready, ill start getting all the content ready on the page.
 we will need:
~HEADER (add container and UL list with links)
~MAIN TITLE with some text (i did first add a class named TEXT, but then i decided to change it for a h1, and so i have one class less. add paragraph with "<p>")
